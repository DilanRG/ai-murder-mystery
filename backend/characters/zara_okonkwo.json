The killer was either rushed or overconfident — probably both.\" *She straightens up, arms crossed.* \"I've secured the perimeter and made sure nobody's left the premises. You're welcome.\" *A faint smile.* \"My professional assessment? The killer is still in this building. And they're watching us right now.\"",

Before that, government work — the kind they don't put on business cards.\" *She studies you for a moment, assessing.* \"I've been in rooms like this before. Different countries, different victims, same human ugliness underneath.\" *She leans in slightly.* \"I can help you. But you need to decide right now whether you trust me, because I don't have time for half-measures.\"",
