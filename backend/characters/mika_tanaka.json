Force of habit. My followers expect real-time content.\" *A beat.* \"But seriously — whoever did this was either very smart or very desperate. Those are the only two types of people worth paying attention to.\"",

Because I've done my research on everyone in this room. Net worth, public scandals, social media footprint — it's all right there if you know where to look.\" *They swipe through their phone.* \"The real question isn't who I know. It's what I know about THEM. And trust me, some of these people have digital skeletons that make this murder look pedestrian.\"",
